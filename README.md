# Presentations
(Probably) all my meaningful presentations

A few rules that I followed:
- every presentation is put into a separate directory
- no matter if I use `revealjs` or `remarkjs` I tend to use markdown. All the content of the presentation should be available in `./content.md` file
- new presentations will have a regular `README.md` containig the full title and the abstract
